Abstract
The aim of this study was to gain insight into the maximum output level of the B81 bone conduction transducer and to compare it to the B71. Additionally, the vibrotactile thresholds of the B81 were examined, as well as the clinically useful range of the B81 in relation to both the maximum output level and vibrotactile thresholds. 
A literature review of PubMedÂ® was conducted in January 2023. 
The results showed that the B81 maximum output level was 10.7 to 22.0 dB higher for frequencies below 1500 Hz compared to the B71, with the largest difference at 250 Hz. The spread in maximum output level between different vibrator exemplars for both transducers was minimal, with the B81 having even less spread than the B71. In general, the vibrotactile thresholds by a bone vibrator on the mastoid were found to be around 37 dB, 55 dB, and 75 dB at 250, 500, and 1000 Hz, respectively. However, the results from different studies showed a large variation, which can be attributed to differences in methodology (e.g. equipement, measurement protocol, population). For the B71, the maximum output level is close to the vibrotactile threshold. The maximum output level of the B81 was found to be close to the vibrotactile threshold + 1 standard deviation in the range 250-1500 Hz. 
This study concludes that there is a high risk that a vibrotactile threshold will be identified instead of an auditory threshold as the maximum output level is approached, especially with the B81. 
A proposal for clinical practice is presented, which suggests dividing the bone vibrator dynamic range into two areas: a normal range and an extended range. The normal range has a low chance of inducing a vibrotactile sensation, while the extended range has a greater chance. This division of the measurement range can also support the interpretation of the audiogram and could potentially be programmed into the audiometer.
